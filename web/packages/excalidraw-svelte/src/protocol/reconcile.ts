 * the web and Swift clients so they converge bit-for-bit:
 *
 *   1. higher `version` wins;
 *   2. on equal `version`, the lower `versionNonce` wins.
 *
 * The rule is a total order on `(version desc, versionNonce asc)`, so it is
 * **symmetric**: whichever side a peer holds locally, both peers pick the same
 * winner — no central authority or CRDT needed. Soft-deletes (`isDeleted`) carry
 * a bumped version like any other edit, so deletion races resolve the same way.
