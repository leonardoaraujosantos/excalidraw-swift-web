# Excalidraw-Swift

A native iOS (iPhone + iPad) port of [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) in Swift / SwiftUI, aiming for feature parity with the web app, first-class Apple Pencil support, and finger-friendly UX.

> Status: **planning**. No app code yet — this repo currently holds the investigation and plan derived from the upstream Excalidraw source.

## Design decisions
- **Rendering:** SwiftUI `Canvas` + Core Graphics (static scene + interactive overlay), with a Swift port of rough.js (`RoughKit`) for the hand-drawn look.
- **Minimum OS:** iOS 17+ (`@Observable`, mature Canvas, Apple Pencil hover on 17.5+).
- **Delivery:** vertical-slice-first — a thin end-to-end path early, then widen.
- **Quality:** >90% test coverage, golden-image render tests, XCUITest e2e on iPhone + iPad.
- **Compatibility:** `.excalidraw` / `.excalidrawlib` round-trip with excalidraw.com.

## Documents
- **[docs/INVESTIGATION.md](docs/INVESTIGATION.md)** — analysis of the upstream source: data model, file format, rendering pipeline, interaction model, geometry/math, and full feature inventory.
- **[docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md)** — architecture, Swift package structure, key design decisions, testing strategy, risks.
- **[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)** — phased delivery plan (Phase 0 foundations → Phase 8 collaboration).

## Building

The iOS app's `ExcalidrawSwift.xcodeproj` is generated from `project.yml` by
[XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonsm/XcodeGen) and is **gitignored** — it is
derived from the SwiftPM package. Regenerate it after cloning or after any
package change:

```sh
brew install xcodegen        # once
./scripts/generate.sh        # regenerate ExcalidrawSwift.xcodeproj
open ExcalidrawSwift.xcodeproj
```

If Xcode reports **"Missing package product"**, the project is stale — rerun
`./scripts/generate.sh`, then close/reopen the project (or File ▸ Packages ▸
Reset Package Caches). The libraries build and test without Xcode via
`swift build` / `swift test`.

## Architecture at a glance
Layered, framework-light core (pure Swift, simulator-independent) under a thin SwiftUI shell:

`ExcalidrawMath` → `ExcalidrawModel` → `ExcalidrawGeometry` · `RoughKit` · `FreehandKit` → `ExcalidrawRender` → `ExcalidrawUI` → `ExcalidrawApp`

See [PLAN.md §2](docs/PLAN.md) for details.
