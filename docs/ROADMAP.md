# Excalidraw-Swift — Roadmap

Vertical-slice-first delivery: get a thin end-to-end path working early (draw → rough render → select/move → save/load → export), then widen feature by feature. Each phase ends with a working, tested build. Coverage gate (≥90%) and CI green are exit criteria for every phase.

Legend: 🎯 milestone deliverable · 🧪 test focus · ⚠️ risk/hard part.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundations & CI
**Goal:** buildable workspace, test harness, coverage gating.
- SwiftPM workspace with the package split from [PLAN.md §2](./PLAN.md): `ExcalidrawMath`, `ExcalidrawModel`, `ExcalidrawGeometry`, `RoughKit`, `FreehandKit`, `ExcalidrawRender`, `ExcalidrawUI`, `ExcalidrawApp`.
- Xcode app target (iOS 17+), iPhone + iPad. SwiftLint + formatting.
- GitHub Actions: build + `swift test` + `xcodebuild test`, coverage report, 90% gate, golden-image diff artifacts.
- Import upstream test fixtures and a corpus of `.excalidraw` sample files.
- 🎯 CI green on an empty but wired project; one trivial test per package.

## Phase 1 — Domain core: model + geometry + file format ✅
**Goal:** the engine, fully testable, no UI.

> **Status: complete.** Delivered: `ExcalidrawModel` (element model, file format, Scene, Store/Delta/History, Restore), `ExcalidrawMath` (point/vector/angle/range/line/segment/triangle/rectangle/polygon/ellipse/curve), `ExcalidrawGeometry` (bounds + hit-testing). `.excalidraw` round-trips diff-clean against the fixture corpus. **Deferred to later increments/phases:** full rocicorp fractional-indexing + legacy binding-v1 migration (incremental), property-level partial deltas & AppState history (collab-oriented), exact cubic-Bézier bounds and rounded-corner hit-testing, and the heavy curve algorithms — Newton curve↔line intersection, Legendre–Gauss arc length, elbow A* (Phase 7).
- `ExcalidrawMath`: port `packages/math` (point, vector, line, segment, curve, ellipse, polygon, angle, range) 1:1. 🧪 property/fixture tests.
- `ExcalidrawModel`: `ExcalidrawElement` enum + base props, AppState, Scene store with indices, fractional index, Store/Delta/History. Custom `Codable`.
- Persistence: port `restore.ts` as the single load path (index gen, ref repair, binding migration, normalization, clamping). PNG-scene embed deferred.
- `ExcalidrawGeometry`: bounds (incl. rotated + Bézier bbox), hit-testing (ray cast + distance), basic curve sampling. *(Newton intersect, elbow A*, Legendre-Gauss deferred to Phase 7.)*
- 🧪 Codable round-trip on the sample corpus (incl. older schema versions); structural equality after restore→encode; hit-test fixtures.
- ⚠️ Round-trip fidelity vs excalidraw.com — build the interop corpus now.
- 🎯 Load any real `.excalidraw`, mutate via API, save it back, diff-clean.

## Phase 2 — RoughKit + first pixels
**Goal:** the hand-drawn look, one shape on screen.
- `RoughKit`: seeded RNG, polyline perturbation, `Drawable` generation for rectangle/ellipse/polygon/linearPath/curve; fill styles (hachure, cross-hatch, solid, zigzag); dash/dotted; roughness scaling; `preserveVertices`. Renders into `GraphicsContext`/`CGContext`.
- `ExcalidrawRender`: SceneRenderer (static), ShapeCache, `Viewport` transforms, grid.
- Minimal `CanvasView` rendering a loaded scene (read-only) with pan/zoom.
- 🧪 RoughKit determinism (seed → identical paths); golden-image tests vs JS-rendered references for rect/ellipse/diamond/line across fill+stroke styles.
- ⚠️ rough.js visual fidelity — this phase de-risks the whole project.
- 🎯 Open a real `.excalidraw` and see it rendered with the correct hand-drawn look.

## Phase 3 — Interaction loop & first tools (the vertical slice closes)
**Goal:** draw, select, move, resize, rotate, undo, export — end to end.
- Custom `UIViewRepresentable` exposing raw `UITouch` (force, type, coalesced, hover). `PointerController` state machine + `GestureCoordinator` (1-finger action, 2-finger pinch-zoom/pan).
- Tools: selection, rectangle, diamond, ellipse, line. Drag-to-create; multi-select; transform handles (pointer-type-aware sizes); rotation; move.
- Interactive overlay Canvas (selection box, handles, snap-to-grid).
- Undo/redo wired to Store/History.
- Exporter: PNG via `UIGraphicsImageRenderer`.
- Minimal toolbar + a few properties (stroke color, width).
- 🧪 Transform math tests; XCUITest: draw rect → move → resize → undo → export, on iPhone + iPad.
- 🎯 **Vertical slice complete**: create/edit a drawing from scratch and export it.

## Phase 4 — Full tool set & properties
**Goal:** all core element types and styling.
- Tools: arrow (straight/curved), freedraw (`FreehandKit` port, pressure via `UITouch.force` + coalesced touches), text (Core Text `TextLayout`, on-canvas editing), image (insert from Photos/Files, files store), eraser (AnimatedTrail + intersection), hand/pan, laser.
- Properties panel: background color, fill style, stroke style, roundness, opacity, font family/size/text align, arrowheads, arrow type. Color picker + eyedropper.
- Actions: group/ungroup, duplicate, delete, align/distribute/flip, z-order, lock.
- Copy/paste via `UIPasteboard` (native + Excalidraw formats).
- SVG export.
- 🧪 FreehandKit outline tests; TextLayout metrics vs JS fixtures; per-tool e2e steps.
- ⚠️ Core Text metric parity — validate early in this phase.
- 🎯 Feature-complete single-user editor for all core element types.

## Phase 5 — Adaptive UI for iPhone & iPad
**Goal:** great UX on both form factors, Pencil-first.
- Size-class-adaptive layout: iPhone bottom toolbar + bottom-sheet properties, fullscreen dialogs; iPad side panels, floating/docked, hover affordances.
- Apple Pencil: hover preview (17.5+), palm rejection, pen-mode toggle; (Pencil Pro squeeze/roll behind availability checks).
- Context menu (long-press / right-click), command palette, keyboard shortcuts (iPad hardware keyboard), zoom controls, dark mode, zen/view modes.
- Document browser integration (Files app), autosave, recent docs.
- 🧪 Snapshot tests across size classes/orientations; XCUITest on iPhone + iPad; Pencil/pressure paths via injectable input.
- 🎯 Ships as a usable iPhone + iPad app.

## Phase 6 — Library, persistence polish, snapping & binding
**Goal:** the "important" tier from the investigation.
- Library (`.excalidrawlib`): save/browse/search/drag-to-canvas; local persistence.
- Object snapping (point + gap snaps) and snap-line rendering; midpoint snapping.
- Arrow↔shape binding (suggested binding, focus point, fixed-point modes); linear element midpoint editing.
- Image crop editor. PNG scene-embed round-trip. Stats panel. Element linking. Frames (containers, clipping, names).
- 🧪 Binding + snapping fixtures; library round-trip; frame clipping golden images.
- 🎯 Parity with everyday excalidraw.com usage.

## Phase 7 — Advanced geometry & remaining parity
**Goal:** the hard algorithms and long-tail features.
- Elbow arrows: port `heading.ts` + `elbowArrow.ts` (A* grid routing, fixed segments). Newton curve↔line intersection; Legendre-Gauss arc length. (Enables precise binding/curve interactions.)
- Embeddables/iframes (where iOS allows), flowchart helpers.
- Localization infra + initial locales (RTL support).
- Performance pass: profiling, dirty-region overlay, optional Metal fast-path if needed.
- 🧪 Elbow-routing fixtures from upstream; perf benchmarks (large scenes).
- ⚠️ Elbow A* is the most complex single algorithm — schedule generous time.
- 🎯 Feature parity (single-user) with upstream.

## Phase 8 — Collaboration & cloud (optional / future)
**Goal:** multiplayer, if pursued.
- Reuse Delta/Store sync unit + fractional indexing already in place.
- WebSocket/Firebase transport, collaborator cursors/presence, conflict resolution, follow mode.
- Mermaid-to-diagram, spreadsheet charts, AI/magic features as separate opt-in modules.
- 🎯 Real-time collaboration parity.

---

## Sequencing rationale
- **Phases 0–3 close the vertical slice** and de-risk the two scariest unknowns early: rough.js fidelity (Phase 2) and the raw-touch interaction layer (Phase 3).
- **File-format fidelity is front-loaded** (Phase 1) so every later phase reads/writes real Excalidraw files.
- **Hard algorithms (elbow A*, Newton intersect) are deferred** (Phase 7) behind the features that don't need them, so they never block a shippable build.
- **Collaboration is last and optional** but the data model (deltas, fractional indices, version nonces) is built collaboration-ready from Phase 1.
